	* Modified geturl so that CEs can be passed in using ? in the URL
	in addition to the program's -c option.

	* Added `%' to the set of characters allowable in identifiers.

	* Added code so that a constraint expression appended to a URL is
 	properly handled. The CE is stored in in the Connect object. When
	a CE is passed to the request_data member function, Connect
	correctly combines the projection and selection parts of that CE
	with the matching parts of any initial CE. 

	* Fixed up the grammar files for Bison 1.25

Thu Sep 12 14:05:49 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added a new option to geturl; -D which can be used to get data. 

	* Fixed Array::print_array; used indirectly by the new option to
	geturl.

	* Fixed various configure.in files so that the different size ints
	are defined properly.

	* Fixed up the config_dap.h problem in the jg-dods directory.

	* Added classes for 32 bit floats, 32 bit unsigned ints and 16 bit
	signed and unsigned ints. These are *not* built by default - I'll
	let the various users have a chance to include these new classes in
	their software before they are added to the build (and thus must
	be sub-classed by users of the DAP).

	* Fixed configure tests for sem.h prototypes and the semctl union.
	A new test which scans the sem.h header is in aclocal.m4 (in etc)
	and the configure script uses that test.

Tue Aug 13 10:54:02 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bugs in Grid: bad constraint expressions would cause core
	dumps and a bug on the SGI (maybe others) where valid Grids would
	not parse.

	* Added to the Error class so that its methods are more useful
	for correcting errors and displaying messages (see Error.cc).

	* Switched to parser_arg object on all the parsers. parser_arg is
	a simple object used to pass values to and from the bison gnerated
	parsers. You need bison 1.24 or newer.

	* Added _unused_ to config_dap.h; this macro expands to gcc's
	__attribute__((__unused__)) thing. I then tacked `__unused__' on the
	char rcsid[] arrays to suppress warnings from gcc -Wall (and
	highlite the warnings that should be fixed!)

	* Fixed a bug in Clause where non-existent functions were
	evaluated - this caused a core dump.

Fri Aug  9 10:21:06 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bug in Connect where local accesses were not correctly
	detected. Also modified geturl to print a diagnostic when supplied
	with a local file name (or, more to the point, a name without
	`http'). 

Wed Jul 17 15:04:01 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added expr-check target in Makefile.

	* Added new tests for das, dds objects. Added tests for expr-test
	driver. 

Mon Jul  8 16:25:11 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Gui.cc: Added compile-time switch HAVE_EXPECT which is used to
	control use/requirement of expect and tcl. When defined as 1 Expect
	and Tcl are used to communicate with a GUI subprocess. When 0,
	Expect and Tcl are not used (thus the libraries are not required).
	Note that without Expect the GUI used for the transmission
	progress indicator and error reporting is not available.
