	* Fixed bugs in Grid: bad constraint expressions would cause core
	dumps and a bug on the SGI (maybe others) where valid Grids would
	not parse.

	* Added to the Error class so that its methods are more useful
	for correcting errors and displaying messages (see Error.cc).

	* Switched to parser_arg object on all the parsers. parser_arg is
	a simple object used to pass values to and from the bison gnerated
	parsers. You need bison 1.24 or newer.

	* Added _unused_ to config_dap.h; this macro expands to gcc's
	__attribute__((__unused__)) thing. I then tacked `__unused__' on the
	char rcsid[] arrays to suppress warnings from gcc -Wall (and
	highlite the warnings that should be fixed!)

	* Fixed a bug in Clause where non-existent functions were
	evaluated - this caused a core dump.

	* Fixed bug in Connect where local accesses were not correctly
	detected. Also modified geturl to print a diagnostic when supplied
	with a local file name (or, more to the point, a name without
	`http').

	* Added expr-check target in Makefile.

	* Added new tests for das, dds objects. Added tests for expr-test
	driver.

	* Gui.cc: Added compile-time switch HAVE_EXPECT which is used to
	control use/requirement of expect and tcl. When defined as 1 Expect
	and Tcl are used to communicate with a GUI subprocess. When 0,
	Expect and Tcl are not used (thus the libraries are not required).
	Note that without Expect the GUI used for the transmission
	progress indicator and error reporting is not available.
