	* Tested the library code in a number of situations and fixed many
	little bugs.

	* The asynchronous mode for data transfers is broken and is never
	used. 

	* Significantly improved processing of errors - web errors are now
	handled correctly for the DAS and DDS - alas the data will still
	exit when an error is encountered. Note that to fix this problem
	I'll need to use exceptions *or* change the return type of the
	request_data() member function to DDS * (from DDS &). Either one
	will break everyone's code...

	* Fixed the lame-looking progress indicator.

	* dods_root is no longer a global variable that depends on run
	time initialization from g++; now it is a function. This ensures
	that the core software can be linked to program core using linkers
	other than g++.

	* Added better compressor function - look at jg_dods.cc to see how
	it is used.

	* Fixed broken decompression.

Wed Nov 13 10:43:56 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added error MIME headers to the set that can be generated by
	helper functions in cgi_util.cc. The error headers are necessary
	since DODS now must generate all its own MIME headers (see the
	section on NPH CGIs in the CGI spec). MIME error headers should be
	used when an http or www error has been detected - don't use the
	DODS error objects in those cases.

	* Made changes in the Int data types so that expressions with
	UInt32s should work. 

	* Fixed some problems with the GUI. It should work more reliably
	but I doubt that all the problems have been fixed. Needs testing.

	* Now reports most www/http errors, although some clients still
	can't seem to get the GUI to work (e.g., writeval) even though
	geturl can.

	* Now requires version 5.0a of the WWW Library.

	* Many changes based on feedback from the initial version 2.09
	distribution. 

Tue Oct 29 08:23:30 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added UInt32 (32 bit unsigned integers) to the DAP. This
	includes both using them in the DDS and the DAS. When an UInt32 is
	used as an operand in a CE, the other operand is cast to unsigned
	for the comparison operation.

Fri Oct 18 09:35:07 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed various errors in the new Unsigned int classes.

	* Changed the operation of Connect::request_das() and
	request_dds(). They now pass any initial constraint along to the
	respective servers. An initial constraint is one which is supplied
	along with the URL at the time the Connect object is made.

	* The functions set_mine_{text,binary} now produce complete
	HTTP/MIME headers. Thus DODS servers can now be invoked using the
	`nph' feature of CGI 1.1 (done by naming the DODS server dispatch
	script `nph-*'). This solve two problems which appeared with large
	data transfers: Transfers were cut-off before completion when a
	server-determined timeout period elapsed and 2) Some large
	transmissions had an extra byte added into the data stream.

Tue Oct  8 09:23:57 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Modified geturl so that CEs can be passed in using ? in the URL
	in addition to the program's -c option.

	* Added `%' to the set of characters allowable in identifiers.

	* Added code so that a constraint expression appended to a URL is
 	properly handled. The CE is stored in in the Connect object. When
	a CE is passed to the request_data member function, Connect
	correctly combines the projection and selection parts of that CE
	with the matching parts of any initial CE. 

	* Fixed up the grammar files for Bison 1.25

Thu Sep 12 14:05:49 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added a new option to geturl; -D which can be used to get data. 

	* Fixed Array::print_array; used indirectly by the new option to
	geturl. 

Mon Aug 26 13:18:21 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed various configure.in files so that the different size ints
	are defined properly.

	* Fixed up the config_dap.h problem in the jg-dods directory.

	* Added classes for 32 bit floats, 32 bit unsigned ints and 16 bit
	signed and unsigned ints. These are *not* built by default - I'll
	let the various users have a chance to include these new classes in
	their software before they are added to the build (and thus must
	be sub-classed by users of the DAP).

Fri Aug 16 09:34:00 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed configure tests for sem.h prototypes and the semctl union.
	A new test which scans the sem.h header is in aclocal.m4 (in etc)
	and the configure script uses that test.

Tue Aug 13 10:54:02 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bugs in Grid: bad constraint expressions would cause core
	dumps and a bug on the SGI (maybe others) where valid Grids would
	not parse.

	* Added to the Error class so that its methods are more useful
	for correcting errors and displaying messages (see Error.cc).

	* Switched to parser_arg object on all the parsers. parser_arg is
	a simple object used to pass values to and from the bison gnerated
	parsers. You need bison 1.24 or newer.

	* Added _unused_ to config_dap.h; this macro expands to gcc's
	__attribute__((__unused__)) thing. I then tacked `__unused__' on the
	char rcsid[] arrays to suppress warnings from gcc -Wall (and
	highlite the warnings that should be fixed!)

	* Fixed a bug in Clause where non-existent functions were
	evaluated - this caused a core dump.

Fri Aug  9 10:21:06 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bug in Connect where local accesses were not correctly
	detected. Also modified geturl to print a diagnostic when supplied
	with a local file name (or, more to the point, a name without
	`http'). 

Wed Jul 17 15:04:01 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added expr-check target in Makefile.

	* Added new tests for das, dds objects. Added tests for expr-test
	driver. 

Mon Jul  8 16:25:11 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Gui.cc: Added compile-time switch HAVE_EXPECT which is used to
	control use/requirement of expect and tcl. When defined as 1 Expect
	and Tcl are used to communicate with a GUI subprocess. When 0,
	Expect and Tcl are not used (thus the libraries are not required).
	Note that without Expect the GUI used for the transmission
	progress indicator and error reporting is not available.
