The DAP is now covered by the GNU Lesser GPL.

This implementation of the DAP 2.0 now uses libcurl for http/s
communications. It also includes its own HTTP/1.1 compliant caching system
and is MT safe. This means that Win32 clients which use this code can now
take advantage of client-side caching.

The code now defines a default implementation for all methods so that client
programs can be written without subclassing the Byte, ..., Grid data types.
In many cases this makes writing clients simpler.

The software now compiles with gcc-3.2 in addition to gcc-2.95.3 and VC++
6.0. Other parts of the DODS software (e.g., the clients and servers) may not
yet work with the other compilers, although the chances are good they will.
