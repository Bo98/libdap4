Release 3.5.0

This is a beta release of libdap, version 3.5. 

New or changed things in this release:

First, the old 'DODS' CVS module is being broken up to facilitate more
frequent releases of software. libdap++ has a new CVS module named 'libdap.'
To access the software using CVS, use 'cvs co libdap' (where in the past you
used 'cvs co DODS/src/dap' or 'cvs co DODS' and then changed into the
DODS/src/dap directory.

The autoconf scripts have been updated; still no libtool or Makefile.am, but
the scripts are much more robust.

The third-party packages are not bundled with the library. In a sense they
never were, but they _were_ a part of the DODS CVS module. Now it's up to you
to get and install the required packages. Look on the web site (or Google)
for libxml2 and curl. We build using curl version 7.12.3 and libxml
version 2.6.16; curl 7.12.0 should work and older versions of libxml2 should
also work.
