These files are from the GNU libg++ software package. If you'd like the
complete library it may be obtained from ftp.gnu.org or by asking one of the
DODS project technical people for a copy.

The files outbuf.h and .cc are from Nicolai Josuttis' "The C++ Standard
Library" and are not part part of libg++. I use these to build a pipe that 
can be written to using an ostream object.
