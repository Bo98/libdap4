WHAT'S IN THIS DIRECTORY?

  This directory contains the URI/GSO implementation of the DODS Data Access
  Protocol.  Documentation for this software can be found on the DODS home
  page at http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/

  The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is used to provide a uniform way of
  accessing a variety of different types of Earth-science data across the
  internet. 

  The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build
  DODS data servers and client libraries.  The classes may be specialized to
  mimic the behavior of other data access APIs, such as netCDF or HDF.  In
  this way, programs originally meant to work with local data in those
  formats can be re-linked and equipped to work with data stored remotely in
  many different formats.

  The DODS DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. This library
  uses some parts of the the GNU C++ class library libg++.a; it includes
  those parts in its subdirectory `GNU'. You do not need to get a copy of
  libg++.

WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

  This directory also contains test programs for the DAP, a sample
  specialization of the set of classes, and geturl, a useful command-line
  web client created with the DAP.

  We also have a Java version of this class library which interoperates at
  the network level with software which uses this library. In other words,
  client programs built with the Java DAP implementation can communicate
  with servers built with this (C++) implementation of the DAP.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
  library and the geturl client.
