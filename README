This directory contains the URI/GSO implementation of the DODS Data Access
Protocol. Documentation for this software can be found on the DODS home page
at http://dods.gso.uri.edu/DODS.

The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is used to provide a uniform way of accessing
a variety of different types of Earth-science data within DODS.

The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build DODS
data servers and client libraries. The DAP is used to build these programs
and/or libraries by specializing the set of classes it provides so that the
specific requirements of a given API or format can be adequately addressed.

The DODS DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. This library uses
the GNU C++ class library libg++.a. The DAP library contains some classes
made using the GNU class library source code and the GNU tool `genclass'.

Test programs for the DAP are also in this directory as is a sample
specialization of the set of classes.

See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
library. 

Note: As of version 2.12 the core now writes the data document's MIME header
and until I modify the expr-test driver the Makefile's `check' and
`expr-check' targets will fail. Better tests of DODS include using geturl or
a real client. The expr-test driver will be fixed time permitting.
