WHAT'S IN THIS DIRECTORY?

  This directory contains the OPeNDAP C++ implementation of the Data Access
  Protocol (DAP). Documentation for this software can be found on the OPeNDAP
  home page at http://www.opendap.org/ and at the DODS project home page at
  http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/.

  The DAP is used to provide a uniform way of accessing a variety of
  different types of data across the Internet. It was originally part of the
  DODS and then NVODS projects. The focus of those projects was access to
  Earth-Science data, so much of the software developed using the DAP to date
  has centered on that discipline.

  The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build
  data servers and clients. The classes may be specialized to mimic the
  behavior of other data access APIs, such as netCDF. In this way, programs
  originally meant to work with local data in those formats can be re-linked
  and equipped to work with data stored remotely in many different formats.
  The classes can also by specialized to build standalone client programs.

  The DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. Also included in the
  library are classes and utility functions which simplify building clients
  and servers which use the DAP.

WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

  This directory also contains test programs for the DAP, a sample
  specialization of the set of classes, and geturl, a useful command-line
  web client created with the DAP.

  We also have a Java version of this class library which interoperates at
  the network level with software which uses this library. In other words,
  client programs built with the Java DAP implementation can communicate
  with servers built with this (C++) implementation of the DAP.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
  library and the geturl client.
