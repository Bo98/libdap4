This directory contains the URI/GSO implementation of the DODS Data Access
Protocol. Documentation for this software can be found on the DODS home page
accessible from http://dods.gso.uri.edu/.

The Data Access Protocol (DAP) is used to provide a uniform way of accessing
a variety of different types of Earth-science data within DODS.

The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build DODS
data servers and client libraries. The DAP is used to build these programs
and/or libraries by specializing the set of classes it provides so that the
specific requirements of a given API or format are adequately addressed.

The DODS DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. This
library requires the DODS netio library and errmsg library as well as the GNU
C++ class library libg++.a. The DAP library contains some classes made using
the GNU class library source code and the GNU tool `genclass'.

Test programs for the DAP are also in this directory as is a sample
specialization of the set of classes.

See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
library. 

NOTE: If you find a bug in this software or its documentation, please use the
send-pr script (which is in DODS_ROOT/etc) to report the problem. Using
send-pr will help us ensure that your report does not get lost once we
receive it.
