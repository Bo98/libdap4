WHAT'S IN THIS DIRECTORY?

  This directory contains the URI/GSO C++ implementation of the DODS Data
  Access Protocol (DAP). Documentation for this software can be found on the
  DODS home page at http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/

  The DAP is used to provide a uniform way of accessing a variety of
  different types of Earth-science data across the internet.

  The DAP is implemented as a set of C++ classes that can be used to build
  DODS data servers and clients. The classes may be specialized to mimic the
  behavior of other data access APIs, such as netCDF. In this way, programs
  originally meant to work with local data in those formats can be re-linked
  and equipped to work with data stored remotely in many different formats.
  The classes can also by specialized to build standalone client programs.

  The DODS DAP is contained in a single library: libdap++.a. This library
  uses some parts of the the GNU C++ class library libg++.a; it includes
  those parts in its subdirectory `GNU'. You do not need to get a copy of
  libg++. A second library, libdap++-gui.a, is also built. This is
  essentially the same library except that it uses a client's windowing
  system to display status and/or error information during network accesses.
  Only clients should be linked with this library, and only those that will
  be as interactive programs.

WHAT ELSE IS THERE?

  This directory also contains test programs for the DAP, a sample
  specialization of the set of classes, and geturl, a useful command-line
  web client created with the DAP.

  We also have a Java version of this class library which interoperates at
  the network level with software which uses this library. In other words,
  client programs built with the Java DAP implementation can communicate
  with servers built with this (C++) implementation of the DAP.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  See the file INSTALL in this directory for information on building the
  library and the geturl client.
