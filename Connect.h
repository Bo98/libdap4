/** Connect objects are used as containers for information pertaining

    dataset may be either local (for example, a file on the user's own
    computer) or a remote dataset. In the latter case a DODS URL will
    be used to reference the dataset, instead of a filename.

    Connect contains methods which can be used to read the DODS DAS and
    DDS objects from the remote dataset as well as reading 
    data. The class understands in a rudimentary way how DODS
    constraint expressions are formed and how to manage them.

    Connect also provides additional services such as automatic
    decompression of compressed data, transmission progress reports
    and error processing.  Refer to the Gui and Error classes for more
    information about these features. See the DODSFilter class for
    information on servers that compress data.

    @note This file may be built two different ways. If the
    compile-time symbol <tt>GUI</tt> is defined, a version of Connect
    is built which will use a simple graphical window to display
    transmission status information. The graphical display is useful
    for interactive clients, but won't work for non-interactive
    programs. For those clients, build the DAP library with
    <tt>GUI</tt> <i>undefined</i>. Without <tt>GUI</tt> defined,
    errors will result in Connect throwing an Error object. Clients
    can catch these objects and try to correct the error.

/* 
 * $Log: Connect.h,v $
 * Revision 1.58  2002/06/18 15:36:24  tom
 * Moved comments and edited to accommodate doxygen documentation-generator.
 *
 * Revision 1.57  2002/06/03 22:21:15  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-9
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.7  2002/01/17 00:42:03  jimg
 * I added a new method to disable use of the cache. This provides a way
 * for a client to suppress use of the cache even if the user wants it
 * (or doesn't say they don't want it).
 *
 * Revision 1.56  2001/10/14 01:28:38  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-8.
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.6  2001/10/08 17:15:30  jimg
 * Added throw declarations to methods that read data from servers.
 *
 * Revision 1.55  2001/08/27 16:38:34  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-6
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.5  2001/07/28 01:10:41  jimg
 * Some of the numeric type classes did not have copy ctors or operator=.
 * I added those where they were needed.
 * In every place where delete (or delete []) was called, I set the pointer
 * just deleted to zero. Thus if for some reason delete is called again
 * before new memory is allocated there won't be a mysterious crash. This is
 * just good form when using delete.
 * I added calls to www2id and id2www where appropriate. The DAP now handles
 * making sure that names are escaped and unescaped as needed. Connect is
 * set to handle CEs that contain names as they are in the dataset (see the
 * comments/Log there). Servers should not handle escaping or unescaping
 * characters on their own.
 *
 * Revision 1.54  2001/06/15 23:49:01  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-4.
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.4  2001/05/03 19:00:15  jimg
 * Added the _always_validate field.
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.3  2001/04/16 17:10:00  jimg
 * Added a companion field void *_gui for the field Gui *_gui. The former is
 * used when `GUI' is not defined. This makes sure (assuming that the size of
 * the two pointers is identical) that code which uses libdap++-gui.a gets the
 * correct definition of Connect if it does not define GUI itself. Note that the
 * whole `defining GUI' thing is a hack which should go away during some future
 * refactoring of Connect so I'd rather patch around the problem like this than
 * say every client must define GUI or create two include files.
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.2  2001/02/14 00:10:05  jimg
 * Merged code from the trunk's HEAD revision for this/these files onto
 * the release-3-2 branch. This moves the authentication software onto the
 * release-3-2 branch so that it will be easier to get it in the 3.2 release.
 *
 * Revision 1.53  2001/02/12 23:16:32  jimg
 * Fixed an error with the using statements. `using std::vector<string>;' makes
 * g++ barf, but it like using std::string; and using std::vector;.
 *
 * Revision 1.52  2001/02/09 22:25:14  jimg
 * Added extract_auth_info() method to parse username/password information from a
 * URL and record it in this object.
 * Moved set_credentials() method from the header, where it was inline, to the
 * .cc file. Save inlines for performance optimizations.
 * Removed set_username_password() function since dods_username_password() was
 * modified to do its job.
 * Added process_www_errors() to streamline error reporting for both the popup
 * and non-popup version of this class. This friend function is called directly
 * from Connect's methods, not via a libwww callback. This was necessary because
 * it throws Error objects and throws don't (seem to, anyway) work from within
 * callbacks.
 *
 * Revision 1.51  2001/02/05 18:59:31  jgarcia
 * Added support so a Connect object can be created with credentials to be
 * able to resolve challenges issued by web servers (Basic Authentication).
 * Added exception to notify "No Authorization".
 *
 * Revision 1.50  2001/01/26 19:48:09  jimg
 * Merged with release-3-2-3.
 *
 * Revision 1.49.4.1  2000/11/22 05:35:09  brent
 * allow username/password in URL for secure data sets
 *
 * Revision 1.49  2000/09/22 02:17:19  jimg
 * Rearranged source files so that the CVS logs appear at the end rather than
 * the start. Also made the ifdef guard symbols use the same naming scheme and
 * wrapped headers included in other headers in those guard symbols (to cut
 * down on extraneous file processing - See Lakos).
 *
 * Revision 1.48  2000/08/02 22:46:48  jimg
 * Merged 3.1.8
 *
 * Revision 1.38.4.4  2000/08/02 21:10:07  jimg
 * Removed the header config_dap.h. If this file uses the dods typedefs for
 * cardinal datatypes, then it gets those definitions from the header
 * dods-datatypes.h.
 *
 * Revision 1.47  2000/07/26 12:24:01  rmorris
 * Modified intermediate (dod*) file removal under win32 to take into account
 * a 1-to-n correspondence between connect objects and intermediate files.
 * Implemented solution through vector of strings containing the intermediate
 * filenames that are removed when the connect obj's destructor is invoked.
 * Might consider using the same code for unix in the future.  Previous
 * win32 solution incorrectly assumed the correspondence was 1-to-1.
 *
 * Revision 1.46  2000/07/13 07:07:13  rmorris
 * Mod to keep the intermediate file name in the Connect object in the
 * case of win32 (unlink() works differently on win32,  needed another approach).
 *
 * Revision 1.45  2000/07/09 21:57:09  rmorris
 * Mods's to increase portability, minimuze ifdef's in win32 and account
 * for differences between the Standard C++ Library - most notably, the
 * iostream's.
 *
 * Revision 1.44  2000/06/07 18:06:58  jimg
 * Merged the pc port branch
 *
 * Revision 1.43.4.1  2000/06/02 18:16:47  rmorris
 * Mod's for port to Win32.
 *
 * Revision 1.43  2000/04/07 00:19:04  jimg
 * Merged Brent's changes for the progress gui - he added a cancel button.
 * Also repaired the last of the #ifdef Gui bugs so that we can build Gui
 * and non-gui versions of the library that use one set of header files.
 *
 * Revision 1.42  1999/12/15 01:14:37  jimg
 * Added static members to help control the cache.
 *
 * Revision 1.41  1999/12/01 21:37:44  jimg
 * Added members to support caching.
 * Added accessors for cache control. libwww 5.2.9 does not supoort these,
 * however.
 *
 * Revision 1.40  1999/09/03 22:07:44  jimg
 * Merged changes from release-3-1-1
 *
 * Revision 1.39  1999/08/23 18:57:44  jimg
 * Merged changes from release 3.1.0
 *
 * Revision 1.38.4.3  1999/08/28 06:43:03  jimg
 * Fixed the implementation/interface pragmas and misc comments
 *
 * Revision 1.38.4.2  1999/08/10 00:40:04  jimg
 * Changes for the new source code organization
 *
 * Revision 1.38.4.1  1999/08/09 22:57:49  jimg
 * Removed GUI code; reactivate by defining GUI
 *
 * Revision 1.38  1999/05/21 20:41:45  dan
 * Changed default 'gui' flag to 'false' in request_data, and read_data
 * methods.
 *
 * Revision 1.37  1999/04/29 03:04:51  jimg
 * Merged ferret changes
 *
 * Revision 1.36  1999/04/29 02:29:28  jimg
 * Merge of no-gnu branch
 *
 * Revision 1.35.8.1  1999/04/14 22:32:46  jimg
 * Made inclusion of timeval _tv depend on the definition of LIBWWW_5_0. See
 * comments in Connect.cc.
 *
 * Revision 1.35  1999/02/18 19:22:38  jimg
 * Added the field _accept_types and two accessor functions. See Connect.cc and
 * the documentation comments for more information.
 *
 * Revision 1.34  1999/01/21 20:42:01  tom
 * Fixed comment formatting problems for doc++
 *
 * Revision 1.33.4.1  1999/02/02 21:56:56  jimg
 * String to string version
 *
 * Revision 1.33  1998/06/04 06:31:33  jimg
 * Added two new member functions to get/set the www_errors_to_stderr property.
 * Also added a new member _www_errors_to_stderr to hold that property. When
 * true, www errors are printed to stderr in addition to being recorded in the
 * object's Error object. The property is false by default.
 *
 * Revision 1.32  1998/03/19 23:49:28  jimg
 * Removed code associated with the (bogus) caching scheme.
 * Removed _connects.
 *
 * Revision 1.31  1998/02/11 21:28:04  jimg
 * Changed x_gzip/x-gzip to deflate since libwww 5.1 offers internal support
 * for deflate (which uses the same LZW algorithm as gzip without the file
 * processing support of gzip).
 * Added to the arguments accepted by the ctor and www_lib_init so that they
 * can now be called with a flag used to control compression.
 * Fixed up the comments to reflect these changes.
 *
 * Revision 1.30  1998/02/04 14:55:31  tom
 * Another draft of documentation.
 *
 * Revision 1.29  1997/12/18 15:06:10  tom
 * First draft of class documentation, entered in doc++ format,
 * in the comments
 *
 * Revision 1.28  1997/09/22 23:05:45  jimg
 * Added comment info.
 *
 * Revision 1.27  1997/06/06 00:45:15  jimg
 * Added read_data(), parse_mime() and process_data() mfuncs.
 *
 * Revision 1.26  1997/03/23 19:40:20  jimg
 * Added field _comp_childpid. See the note in Connect.cc Re: this field.
 *
 * Revision 1.25  1997/03/05 08:25:28  jimg
 * Removed the static global _logfile. See Connect.cc.
 *
 * Revision 1.24  1997/02/13 17:35:39  jimg
 * Added a field to store information from the MIME header `Server:'. Added
 * a member function to access the value of the field and a MIME header
 * `handler' function to store the value there.
 *
 * Revision 1.23  1997/02/12 21:39:10  jimg
 * Added optional parameter to the ctor for this class; it enables
 * informational error messages from the WWW library layer.
 * * Revision 1.22 1997/02/10 02:31:27 jimg 
 * Changed the return type of request_data() and related functions from DDS &
 * to * DDS *.
 *
 * Revision 1.21  1996/11/25 03:39:25  jimg
 * Added web-error to set of object types.
 * Added two MIME parsers to set of friend functions.
 * Removed unused friend functions.
 *
 * Revision 1.20  1996/11/13 18:57:15  jimg
 * Now uses version 5.0a of the WWW library.
 *
 * Revision 1.19  1996/10/08 17:02:10  jimg
 * Added fields for the projection and selection parts of a CE supplied with
 * the URL passed to the Connect ctor.
 *
 * Revision 1.18  1996/07/10 21:25:34  jimg
 * *** empty log message ***
 *
 * Revision 1.17  1996/06/21 23:14:15  jimg
 * Removed GUI code to a new class - Gui.
 *
 * Revision 1.16  1996/06/18 23:41:01  jimg
 * Added support for a GUI. The GUI is actually contained in a separate program
 * that is run in a subprocess. The core `talks' to the GUI using a pty and a
 * simple command language.
 *
 * Revision 1.15  1996/06/08 00:07:57  jimg
 * Added support for compression. The Content-Encoding header is used to
 * determine if the incoming document is compressed (values: x-plain; no
 * compression, x-gzip; gzip compression). The gzip program is used to
 * decompress the document. The new software uses UNIX IPC and a separate
 * subprocess to perform the decompression.
 *
 * Revision 1.14  1996/06/04 21:33:17  jimg
 * Multiple connections are now possible. It is now possible to open several
 * URLs at the same time and read from them in a round-robin fashion. To do
 * this I added data source and sink parameters to the serialize and
 * deserialize mfuncs. Connect was also modified so that it manages the data
 * source `object' (which is just an XDR pointer).
 *
 * Revision 1.13  1996/05/29 21:51:51  jimg
 * Added the enum ObjectType. This is used when a Content-Description header is
 * found by the WWW library to record the type of the object without first
 * parsing it.
 * Added ctors for the struct constraint.
 * Removed the member _request.
 *
 * Revision 1.12  1996/05/21 23:46:33  jimg
 * Added support for URLs directly to the class. This uses version 4.0D of
 * the WWW library from W3C.
 *
 * Revision 1.11  1996/04/05 01:25:40  jimg
 * Merged changes from version 1.1.1.
 *
 * Revision 1.10  1996/02/01 21:45:33  jimg
 * Added list of DDSs and constraint expressions that produced them.
 * Added mfuncs to manage DDS/CE list.
 *
 * Revision 1.9.2.1  1996/02/23 21:38:37  jimg
 * Updated for new configure.in.
 *
 * Revision 1.9  1995/06/27  19:33:49  jimg
 * The mfuncs request_{das,dds,dods} accept a parameter which is appended to
 * the URL and used by the data server CGI to select which filter program is
 * run to handle a particular request. I changed the parameter name from cgi
 * to ext to better represent what was going on (after getting confused
 * several times myself).
 *
 * Revision 1.8  1995/05/30  18:42:47  jimg
 * Modified the request_data member function so that it accepts the variable
 * in addition to the existing arguments.
 *
 * Revision 1.7  1995/05/22  20:43:12  jimg
 * Removed a paramter from the REQUEST_DATA member function: POST is not
 * needed since we no longer use the post mechanism.
 *
 * Revision 1.6  1995/04/17  03:20:52  jimg
 * Removed the `api' field.
 *
 * Revision 1.5  1995/03/09  20:36:09  jimg
 * Modified so that URLs built by this library no longer supply the
 * base name of the CGI. Instead the base name is stripped off the front
 * of the pathname component of the URL supplied by the user. This class
 * append the suffix _das, _dds or _serv when a Connect object is used to
 * get the DAS, DDS or Data (resp).
 *
 * Revision 1.4  1995/02/10  21:54:52  jimg
 * Modified definition of request_data() so that it takes an additional
 * parameter specifying sync or async behavior.
 *
 * Revision 1.3  1995/02/10  04:43:17  reza
 * Fixed the request_data to pass arguments. The arguments string is added to
 * the file name before being posted by NetConnect. Default arg. is null.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1995/01/31  20:46:56  jimg
 * Added declaration of request_data() mfunc in Connect.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1995/01/10  16:23:04  jimg
 * Created new `common code' library for the net I/O stuff.
 *
 * Revision 1.2  1994/10/05  20:23:28  jimg
 * Fixed errors in *.h files comments - CVS bites again.
 * Changed request_{das,dds} so that they use the field `_api_name'
 * instead of requiring callers to pass the api name.
 *
 * Revision 1.1  1994/10/05  18:02:08  jimg
 * First version of the connection management classes.
